# Manifold-production-instance
Tracking issues with our production instance of Manifold

Our production instance is reachable at `https://manifold.picolabs.io`

Owners can register for an account with Google or GitHub

There is a pico-engine running at `https://manifold.picolabs.io:9090`
which is password-protected.

Ideally, each of the rulesets in the production instance of Manifold
should be identical with the version checked into the Manifold repo.

There is a [diff tool](https://picolab.github.io/Manifold-production-instance/diff.html)
for comparing those known to be in the Manifold repo.

There is also [a spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1adz27dmZQ8p8SAbi0CnYUt0opHSwTWLqotNQcdlolwQ/edit?usp=sharing)
with all of the rulesets in the production instance of Manifold.
Contact me for permission to edit the spreadsheet.
